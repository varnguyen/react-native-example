# React Native Example
My first app build with react native

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

- [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on your computer
> Yarn is a dependency manager built by facebook and google. It is a more efficient and reliable (thanks to yarn.lock) alternative of npm.

- Launch ``` yarn ``` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
> This command will look into the *package.json* file and install all the dependencies listed here.

- Install react-native-cli globally on your computer
```
yarn global add react-native-cli
```

### Ios steps
- Have to Simulator
```
react-native run-ios
```

### Android steps
- Launch a virtual android device [(through *Android Studio* for instance)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#viewing)

> If you have never installed any android virtual device, [follow those instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd)

- Then, run the project in executing on your project folder:

```
react-native run-android
```
